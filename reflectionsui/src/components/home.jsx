          Ever meet faeries when you were a small child? Sophie did. She has
          seen them many times since, but they have been too skittish about her
          approaches.

        <p>
          That is, until nightmarish fey kidnap a neighbor child. One she
          babysat often. Now, pursued by the same fey, she enters a dangerous
          world where faeries fear knife wielding creatures that can command the
          very earth she walks upon.
        </p>
        <p>
          She must avoid their curses, their attempts to steal her person and
          her memories all to rescue a small child that no one, not even her
          parents, knows is missing.
